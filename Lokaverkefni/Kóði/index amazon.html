                    <p>The Amazon rainforest, alternatively, the Amazon Jungle, also known in English as Amazonia, is a moist broadleaf tropical rainforest in the Amazon biome that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America. This basin encompasses 7,000,000 km2 (2,700,000 sq mi), of which 5,500,000 km2 (2,100,000 sq mi) are covered by the rainforest. This region includes territory belonging to nine nations.Nine countries share the Amazon basin—most of the rainforest 58.4%, is contained within the borders of Brazil. The other eight countries include Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guyana and Ecuador in decending order of surface area of the forest. Four nations have "Amazonas" as the name of one of their first-level administrative regions and France uses the name "Guiana Amazonian Park" for its rainforest protected area. The Amazon represents over half of the planet's remaining rainforests, and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world, with an estimated 390 billion individual trees divided into 16,000 species.The rainforest likely formed during the Eocene era (from 56 million years to 33.9 million years ago). It appeared following a global reduction of tropical temperatures when the Atlantic Ocean had widened sufficiently to provide a warm, moist climate to the Amazon basin. The rainforest has been in existence for at least 55 million years, and most of the region remained free of savanna-type biomes at least until the current ice age when the climate was drier and savanna more widespread.</p>

                        <p>The name Amazon is said to arise from a war Francisco de Orellana fought with the Tapuyas and other tribes. The women of the tribe fought alongside the men, as was their custom. Orellana derived the name Amazonas from the Amazons of Greek mythology, described by Herodotus and Diodorus.</p>

                        <p> Tribal societies are well capable of escalation to all-out wars between tribes. Thus, in the Amazonas, there was perpetual animosity between the neighboring tribes of the Jivaro. Several tribes of the Jivaroan group, including the Shuar, practised headhunting for trophies and headshrinking which was the unfortunate end for some foreign travelers at the time. The accounts of missionaries to the area in the borderlands between Brazil and Venezuela have recounted constant infighting in the Yanomami tribes. More than a third of the Yanomamo males, on average, died from warfare. </p>

                    <p> Wet tropical forests are the most species-rich biome, and tropical forests in the Americas are consistently more species rich than the wet forests in Africa and Asia. As the largest tract of tropical rainforest in the Americas, the Amazonian rainforests have unparalleled biodiversity. One in ten known species in the world lives in the Amazon rainforest. This constitutes the largest collection of living plants and animal species in the world.The region is home to about 2.5 million insect species, tens of thousands of plants, and some 2,000 birds and mammals. To date, at least 40,000 plant species, 2,200 fishes, 1,294 birds, 427 mammals, 428 amphibians, and 378 reptiles have been scientifically classified in the region. One in five of all bird species are found in the Amazon rainforest, and one in five of the fish species live in Amazonian rivers and streams. Scientists have described between 96,660 and 128,843 invertebrate species in Brazil alone.The biodiversity of plant species is the highest on Earth with one 2001 study finding a quarter square kilometer (62 acres) of Ecuadorian rainforest supports more than 1,100 tree species. A study in 1999 found one square kilometer (247 acres) of Amazon rainforest can contain about 90,790 tonnes of living plants. To date, an estimated 438,000 species of plants of economic and social interest have been registered in the region with many more remaining to be discovered or catalogued. The total number of tree species in the region is estimated at 16,000.The green leaf area of plants and trees in the rainforest varies by about 25% as a result of seasonal changes. Leaves expand during the dry season when sunlight is at a maximum, then undergo abscission in the cloudy wet season. These changes provide a balance of carbon between photosynthesis and respiration.</p>




                    <p>Based on archaeological evidence from an excavation at Caverna da Pedra Pintada, human inhabitants first settled in the Amazon region at least 11,200 years ago. Subsequent development led to late-prehistoric settlements along the periphery of the forest by AD 1250, which induced alterations in the forest cover. For a long time, it was thought that the Amazon rainforest was never more than sparsely populated, as it was impossible to sustain a large population through agriculture given the poor soil. Archeologist Betty Meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea, as described in her book Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise. She claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre  is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a larger population.  Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500, divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at Marajó, and inland dwellers.</p>

The rainforest has been in existence for at least 55 million years, and most of the region remained free of savanna-type biomes at least until the current ice age when the climate was drier and savanna more widespread. More than 56% of the dust fertilizing the Amazon rainforest comes from the Bodélé depression in Northern Chad in the Sahara desert. The dust contains phosphorus, important for plant growth. The yearly Sahara dust replaces the equivalent amount of phosphorus washed away yearly in Amazon soil from rains and floods. The Amazon rainforest climate on average is like that of any other typical tropical rainforest. It is hot and humid. The temperature is around 28°Celcius for the entire year which gets compounded due to the heavy humidity.</p>

                    <h2>Tourism and Travel</h2>


                
                    <p>May to June is a great time to visit the Amazon, being midway between the rainiest months and the hottest driest ones . It’s also when the water level in the Amazon River is highest and the surrounding forest is flooded. The Amazon rises and falls by an amazing 12 to 15 meters annually, and few experiences are more sublime, or uniquely Amazonian, than gliding silently in a canoe through the flooded forest. That said, the dry season is attractive for its clear weather and opportunities for long hikes. Offering an immersive experience, lodges are set within or close to wildlife reserves. They are surrounded by the sights and sounds of the jungle. And by taking guided excursions, guests can explore the rainforest around them in greater depth. Generally, the more remote lodges offer greater wildlife sightings. In contrast to jungle lodges, river cruises have the advantage of mobility. They allow you to discover a greater area and different ecosystems within the Amazon rainforest. You'll have several excursions where you disembark and enjoy activities during the day, then return to your cabin in the evening to sleep. A range of cruise types are available depending on where you want to go. Smaller tourist boats can take you deeper into the Amazon rainforest along narrow tributaries. Larger luxury cruises offer a similar experience to a five-star hotel, with amenities such as air conditioning, private showers and gourmet food. Not every journey into the Amazon will involve a multi-day expedition upriver. A soaring stand of primary rainforest lies equidistant between Santarém and the languid river resort of Alter do Chão, and is easily accessible by road. And while you may see wildlife – jaguars, howler monkeys, squirrel monkeys and capuchins all inhabit the forest here – it’s the trees that really impress. </p>

                        <p>Enjoy traditional Peruvian cuisine, which is often regarded as one of the world’s best, some local Amazon food, and different dishes, juices, and desserts influenced by the surrounding rainforest. Reserves such as Xixuaú and Mamirauá are available to visit. Se stunning forests, lakes and river filled to the brim with wildlife and wonder. Just make sure that you have a travel guide or be familiar with the environment before you start venturing into the wild green yonder. And remember to not litter to keep the beautiful forest green.</p>
