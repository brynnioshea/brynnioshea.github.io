					<h2>Information</h2>

			
					<p>The Bahamas, known officially as the Commonwealth of The Bahamas, is a country within the Lucayan Archipelago in the West Indies. It is a member of the Commonwealth Realms under the monarchy of Queen Elizabeth II. The archipelagic state consists of more than 700 islands, cays, and islets in the Atlantic Ocean, and is located north of Cuba and Hispaniola Island (Haiti and the Dominican Republic), northwest of the Turks and Caicos Islands, southeast of the US state of Florida, and east of the Florida Keys. The capital is Nassau on the island of New Providence. The Royal Bahamas Defence Force describes The Bahamas' territory as encompassing 470,000 km2 (180,000 sq mi) of ocean space.The Bahamas were inhabited by the Lucayans, a branch of the Arawakan-speaking Taíno people, for many centuries. Columbus was the first European to see the islands, making his first landfall in the 'New World' in 1492. Later, the Spanish shipped the native Lucayans to slavery on Hispaniola, after which the Bahama islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648, when English colonists from Bermuda settled on the island of Eleuthera.The Bahamas gained governmental independence in 1973 led by Sir Lynden O. Pindling, with Elizabeth II as its queen. In terms of gross domestic product per capita, The Bahamas is one of the richest countries in the Americas (following the United States and Canada), with an economy based on tourism and offshore finance.</p>

						<p>The name Bahamas is most likely derived from either the Taíno ba ha ma ("big upper middle land"), which was a term for the region used by the indigenous people, or possibly from the Spanish baja mar ("shallow water or sea" or "low tide") reflecting the shallow waters of the area. Alternatively, it may originate from Guanahani.</p>

					<p> The first inhabitants of The Bahamas were the Taino people, who moved into the uninhabited southern islands from Hispaniola and Cuba around the 800s–1000s AD, having migrated there from South America; they came to be known as the Lucayan people. An estimated 30,000 Lucayans inhabited The Bahamas at the time of Christopher Columbus's arrival in 1492.The word The constitutes an integral part of the short form of the name and is, therefore, capitalised. So – in contrast to "the Congo" and "the United Kingdom" – it is proper to write "The Bahamas". The name The Bahamas is thus comparable with certain non-English names that also use the definite article, such as Las Vegas or Los Angeles. The Constitution of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas, the country's fundamental law, capitalises the "T" in "The Bahamas".	The 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas theoretically divided the new territories between the Kingdom of Castile and the Kingdom of Portugal, placing The Bahamas in the Spanish sphere; however they did little to press their claim on the ground. The Spanish did however make use of the native Lucayan peoples, many of whom were enslaved and sent to Hispaniola for use as forced labour. The slaves suffered from harsh conditions and most died from contracting diseases to which they had no immunity; half of the Taino died from smallpox alone. As a result of these depredations the population of The Bahamas was severely diminished.

					<p>The Bahamas consists of a chain of islands spread out over some 800 kilometres  in the Atlantic Ocean, located to the east of Florida in the United States, north of Cuba and Hispaniola and west of the British Overseas Territory of the Turks and Caicos Islands (with which it forms the Lucayan archipelago). There are some 700 islands and cays in total (of which 30 are inhabited) with a total land area of 10,010 km2 . Nassau, capital city of The Bahamas, lies on the island of New Providence; the other main inhabited islands are Grand Bahama, Eleuthera, Cat Island, Rum Cay, Long Island, San Salvador Island, Ragged Island, Acklins, Crooked Island, Exuma, Berry Islands, Mayaguana, the Bimini islands, Great Abaco and Great Inagua. The largest island is Andros. All the islands are low and flat, with ridges that usually rise no more than 15 to 20 m . The highest point in the country is Mount Alvernia (formerly Como Hill) on Cat Island at 64 m .</p>

		


					<p>As with most tropical climates, seasonal rainfall follows the sun, and summer is the wettest season. There is only a 7 °C (13 °F) difference between the warmest month and coolest month in most of the Bahama islands. Every few decades low temperatures can fall below 10 °C (50 °F) for a few hours when a severe cold outbreak comes down from the North American mainland, however there has never been a frost or freeze recorded in the Bahama islands. Only once in recorded history has snow been seen in the air anywhere in The Bahamas, this occurred in Freeport on 19 January, 1977, when snow mixed with rain was seen in the air for a short time. The Bahamas are often sunny and dry for long periods of time, and average more than 3,000 hours or 340 days of sunlight annually. Much of the natural vegetation is tropical scrub and cactus and succulents are common in landscapes. But when you visit you will be sure to get a nice tan.</p>

					<h2>Tourism and Travel</h2>


				
					<p>The Bahamas relies heavily on tourism to generate most of its economic activity. Tourism as an industry not only accounts for about 50% of the Bahamian GDP, but also provides jobs for about half of the country's workforce. The Bahamas is known for its stellar beaches. With over 700 breathtaking islands and cays, and the clearest water on Earth, it’s no wonder visitors come here from all around to sink their toes into miles of pure white, and in some places pink, sand—the very definition of paradise.The islands play host to numerous natural and manmade attractions that offer a glimpse into our rich culture. Guided tours offered are both educational and exciting, and you should try as many as possible to get the full Bahamian experience. You can walk, or go by bike, jeep, or scooter. The fun-filled activities here can be enjoyed by the entire family. Throw on a saddle and trot along our shores on horseback. Tour one of the interesting sites, or shop in a kid-friendly marketplace. Play volleyball, picnic, or hunt for treasure on the beach. Discover underwater delights while boating or snorkeling. Take the opportunity to discover Bahamian cuisine while you’re here. It’s spicy and uniquely flavored. Beginning with local ingredients—tropical fruit, seafood, and spices—our eateries run the spectrum. Down-home restaurants will feature traditional Bahamian favorites, while more artisan options will combine international cuisine with island flavor. When the moon lights up the night sky, entertainment awakens here. Enjoy our traditional music in quaint bars, the latest sounds in city-style nightclubs, or try your hand in a casino. On the outer islands, you could simply sit on a beach and watch a bonfire under the full moon.</p>
